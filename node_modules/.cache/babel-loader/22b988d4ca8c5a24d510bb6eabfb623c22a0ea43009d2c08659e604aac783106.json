The address tab and about tab \n            both highlight statistics relevant to current situations. The map address tab \n            shows the distance to the eatery from the user’s current location, while the about tab highlights \n            the current time slot in the “popular times” section, addressing both functional and non-functional requirements.\n          </p>\n\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={horizontal2MobileImg} />\n              <img src={horizontal2Img} alt=\"Horizontal MFP 2\" className=\"explain-img\" />\n            </picture>\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            On the same page, users can tap the “Review” tab to see existing reviews for the eatery. \n            There is a button labeled “Leave a review.” By pressing this button, users can write their \n            own review using the 5-star rating system.

For instance, when implementing a prototype using Figma, \n            we struggled to fix a footer that could move to another page at the bottom of the screen. The original intention \n            was to create a long scrollable screen in Figma; however, we could not find a way to keep the footer at the bottom \n            while allowing users to scroll freely. Consequently, we ended up with a screen where the bottom was cropped and overlapped \n            by the footer, creating the illusion of more content than available.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Furthermore, by addressing one issue in the interaction paths, we inadvertently constructed paths without considering \n            that modifications needed to be applied to all pages containing the object. This led to less varied outputs \n            based on user interactions than we had anticipated.\n          </p>\n\n          {/* 인지적 워크스루 섹션 */}\n          <h3 className=\"explain__title\">Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Context and scenario given to the evaluator:</strong><br />\n            You are a new student at Simon Fraser University. \n            You are having difficulty finding a place to eat around the Burnaby campus, \n            where you spend most of your day. You heard about the SFU Snap app \n            during the welcome orientation and decided to use the dining feature to find a \n            good place to eat. After selecting a nearby eatery, you want to view the reviews \n            and decide to leave feedback about your experience.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Your task:</strong><br />\n            1.

Leave a review about your experience with the eatery in the system.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <img src={tableImg} alt=\"Cognitive Walkthrough Table\" className=\"explain-img\" />\n          </div>\n          <h3 className=\"explain__title\">Summary of Walkthrough:</h3>\n          <p>\n            The walkthrough was completed without significant issues. The evaluator commented that our design was intuitive and visually appealing, \n            allowing them to navigate through tasks easily. For instance, for task 1, they were able to locate the review page for the selected eatery \n            due to clearly labeled buttons. The evaluator also praised the overall design and effective use of space.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, despite these strengths, the evaluator raised some concerns. For task 1, while finding the navigation paths was straightforward, \n            they encountered some stub buttons that responded but lacked functionality, leading to confusion about their purpose. \n            For task 2, although they quickly grasped the star rating system, they hesitated to tap on the gray button because of the absence of instructions.\n            To resolve these issues, we could implement more functional buttons on the grid rather than displaying “under development” prompts. \n            Additionally, adding a prompt such as “Please tap on the stars to rate” above the star rating system could enhance clarity for users.\n          </p>\n\n          {/* Reflection 섹션 */}\n          <h3 className=\"explain__title\">Reflection</h3>\n          <p>\n            The redesign of the SFU Snap app was an interesting challenge because we were not only tasked with \n            revamping an existing app but also had to design a new review system integrated into an existing feature. \n            This experience required us to study the overall design to ensure consistency across all aspects of the app. \n            It provided us with a valuable opportunity to apply classroom learning to real-world problems.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The process began with a heuristic evaluation of the SFU Snap app, utilizing Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics for User Interface Design. \n            This evaluation provided us with a clear understanding of usability principles and what constitutes a good user interface. \n            We explored the app firsthand and conducted interviews with several students who regularly use the SFU Snap app, enabling us to identify a range of features, \n            both positive and negative, in terms of usability heuristics. We learned much from the flaws in the app, informing us of what to avoid in our design.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For context identification, we interviewed students and faculty members at SFU about their experiences with the app and their expectations for a review feature. \n            This insightful opportunity allowed us to hear actual users’ opinions, helping us identify common themes among the interviewees and establish a strong context for our project.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            From the context and interviews, we developed three distinct personas. This process was straightforward since we could directly use the goals and struggles identified \n            during the interviews. While not every idea linked directly to the review mechanism, we generated relevant concepts based on responses from the interviewees.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We dedicated considerable time to identifying meaningful struggles for the personas, as we believed the functional requirements should focus on solving those issues. \n            Our goal was for the functional requirements to be meaningful and impactful. Once we established the functional requirements, we brainstormed non-functional requirements \n            for each functional requirement, aiming to enhance convenience for users. We reviewed lecture slides and other examples, such as Google Reviews, to ensure that our \n            non-functional requirements were equally meaningful, as we believed that effective functional and non-functional requirements would lay a solid foundation for good user interface design.\n          </p> \n          <p>\n            Using these functional requirements, we created LFP sketches. As discussed in part 2b, we integrated our LFPs from part 1 with features from other services. \n            The transition from sketches to MFP was the most challenging aspect of our project. Both of us were relatively inexperienced with Figma, so we relied on tutorials \n            to familiarize ourselves with the tool. We aimed for the final product to be as polished as possible, which required gathering images, reviews, and properly documenting our sources. \n            The end result was satisfactory, but we recognize there is still room for improvement.\n          </p>\n          <p>    \n            One area where we could have improved was to implement more functional buttons instead of leaving stubs that led to prompts stating “under development.” \n            Our focus was more on incorporating functionalities that met our requirements, which led us to run out of time as adding all the buttons was very time-consuming.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another potential improvement would be to retain more elements of the original design. Currently, we have diverged from the SFU identity by not utilizing SFU colors. \n            While this is more of an aesthetic consideration, we believe it is important since the SFU Snap app is the official application for SFU.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Additionally, as noted in part 2b, we faced specific limitations within Figma that we could not overcome. If given another opportunity, we may explore alternative tools or \n            find ways to bypass these limitations for better design outcomes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The final step was conducting a cognitive walkthrough. Before beginning the walkthrough, we reviewed the materials from week 10, including suggested readings and videos, \n            to ensure we understood the process and expected outcomes. The walkthrough proceeded smoothly, a sentiment we felt confident about beforehand due to our strong final designs. \n            However, the feedback and issues raised by the evaluator provided us with a new perspective on our design and potential areas for improvement, as highlighted in the summary above.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Overall, this assignment was challenging due to the multitude of new concepts and tools we had to familiarize ourselves with. However, we were pleased with how our design \n            turned out and how, as a team and as students, we learned and understood so much from the experience of redesigning the SFU SNAP app and implementing the review feature.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <iframe\n            width=\"1024\"\n            height=\"576\"\n
