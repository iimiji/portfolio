She isn't very good with smartphones, but she likes to take pictures with it to create new memories.\n            Her pain point is she wants to message her family but doesn't want to bother them because of the time difference. She wants to learn how to use apps that would make it easy to communicate with family, but she doesn’t have the knowledge and couldn't get help to do so.\n            The solution is to design an app that is considerate of each user's time zone differences and provide a service with minimal effort and learning stages.\n          </p>\n          <span className=\"explain__subtitle\">Persona 02: Jason Smith</span>\n          <p>\n            Our second persona is Jason Smith, an 85-year-old married senior living in Vancouver. \n            He is the namesake of our application, ROOT.

users have four different menus to either view their family member profiles, see updates or memories, access their photo album, and play games with their family members online. \n            On each member’s profile, users can see the country they are in, their time zone, and the weather.\n            From the profile, they can directly voice or video call or send a message. \n            When the user wants to send a message, they can schedule it based on time zones, setting it to send in the morning, evening, or customizing it for their preference.\n            In the sharing memories section, users can upload and react to any updates, images, or videos that members post.\n            In the photo album, they can view all images within the app and upload any photos they have taken. \n            Finally, in the games section, users have access to various games that they can play or compete with their family online, such as Pictionary, Wordle, or Scrabble.\n          </p>\n

Mika in Japan.\n            She wants to text her daughter but doesn’t want to bother her late at night.\n            So, she opens the ROOT app, and from the main menu, she selects ‘view members’.\n            She finds Mika’s profile and sees that it’s 2:00 AM in Japan.\n            She selects send message and proceeds to write a morning message to Mika, setting it to arrive at 9:00 AM in Japan.\n            The next day, Mika wakes up and receives the message her mother has sent.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source

easy-to-use platform for seniors to communicate with their family abroad. \n            We began by exploring different design variations for our application based on our personas from last week: experimenting with different color palettes, interaction elements, and more. \n            With the first design, we made the main interaction with family members to be all from the member profile. \n            In the second design, we focused on a different theme and color, with a mix of orange and blue and simple interactions. \n            Finally, in the third design, we tried to use bigger buttons and image sizes for easier interactions for the elders, which was the design we decided to focus on.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n

Roboto, which consists of modern and simplified characters with good readability.\n            We mainly used orange as the primary color. The warm color helps bring warmth and intimacy to our application. \n            We paid attention to font size and color contrast to enhance accessibility for users who might have a harder time reading texts on mobile.\n            To maintain consistency and simplify development, we used a layout grid of four columns.\n            We focused on using well-structured interface elements and larger icons with text for a more user-friendly interaction for seniors who may be struggling with vision or fine motor control issues.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={styleGuideMobileImg} />\n              <img src={styleGuideImg} alt=\"Style Guide\" className=\"explain-img\" />\n            </picture>\n          </div>\n\n          {/* User Flow */}\n          <h3 className=\"explain__title\">User Flow</h3>\n          <span className=\"explain__subtitle\">User Login</span>\n          <p>\n            The user flow for the login page: when a user opens our application, first there is a splash screen, followed by a login screen. For first-time users without an account, they will need to register via name, email, date of birth, and set a password.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <img

     At the very top, users can see their profile, followed by a search bar that allows them to search for specific family members.\n            Considering the feedback we received last week, we designed our home page so that users can access family members directly to create a more family-oriented application.\n            On the family members’ profiles, users can engage with them in different ways, such as sending messages, voice calls, and video calls.\n            They can also see the country their family members are in, their time zone, and the weather.\n          </p>\n

to include was the birthday feature that allows users to know when it is a family member's birthday. \n            We included a one-time pop-up that shows when a user opens the app and a birthday cake icon that is displayed on the member throughout their birthday. \n            We also included a feature that allows users to pin specific family members for easier accessibility.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={birthdayFeatureMobileImg} />\n              <img src={birthdayFeatureImg}

user can input their message either by their keyboard or through the speech-to-text feature, where they can use the microphone icon to input their voice, which was included for seniors who might have a harder time typing their message.\n            Finally, once the user hits send, a message sent page appears with confirmation of when it will be sent to the family member.\n          </p>\n

introduced send message feature, the message page allows users to view previous conversation records or continue the conversation directly. \n            Users can select to pin the chat window that they chat with the most, and they can also check reserved messages that have yet to be sent. \n            Additional functions on this page include group chat, group call, and group video call.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={messagePageMobileImg} />\n              <img src={messagePageImg}

page, memory, is designed to allow families to share their week with family members based on photos. \n            Photos of family members are collected by day of the week and shown on the feed, allowing families to communicate through likes and comments. \n            The third screen is an upload screen, with the days of the week indicated based on the access date, configured as an intuitive and efficient interface.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={memoryPageMobileImg} />\n

        <p>\n            The last page is a profile page where users can manage their profile and notification or language preferences. \n            In the Edit profile section, users can modify or

       {/* User Study Plan */}\n          <h3 className=\"explain__title\">User Study Plan</h3>\n          <p>\n            Our primary purpose of the usability testing was to validate and refine user performance of ROOT’s application based on the experiences of users who already communicate with their families abroad. \n            Our team chose to use the think-aloud and user interview feedback method for our user study. \n            We participated in this study with six participants who have families living abroad. \n            Martin and Marie, who contacted their families in Korea from Vancouver, conducted a user study in-person.\n            Kim and Jeon, who reached their families in Vancouver from Korea, and Janice and Zihan, who contacted their families in China from Canada, participated via video call.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n              <source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcSet={userStudyPlanMobileImg} />\n

information about what and for whom our ROOT application was designed.\n            Second, a pre-test interview, where participants were asked about how they currently connect with their families abroad.\n            Third, testing tasks, where participants received either a link or a device with our Protopie prototype and were asked various tasks to complete based on our usability task list.\n            Lastly, a post-test interview, where participants were asked questions to gather their overall feedback about our application.\n          </p>\n          <div

first design issue we found from the user study was that the message page lacked clear indications for users to create new family group chats. \n            Some users pointed out that they were confused by the different design layouts of group chats and single member chats, as it wasn’t consistent.\n            The second issue was that while many users had an overall straightforward process for sending a scheduled message, we found that they weren’t utilizing the microphone or the customize icon for selecting time due to poor visibility and unclear usage indications.\n            The third issue was the calendar icon on each user’s week; the icon didn’t have a specific purpose, leading to confusion about its interactivity.\n            The last issue was that the sharing memory page lacked clear indicators for the various steps required to successfully upload images to their week.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"img-box\">\n            <picture>\n

To improve our first issue regarding the memory page, we plan to redesign the chat layouts to maintain consistency and clearly indicate the option to create new group chats at the top of the screen,
